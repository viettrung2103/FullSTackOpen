# FullSTackOpen
This is the repository where I store all the exercise for the Full Stack Open Course from Helsinki University
ex 0.4-0.6: I learn about how website GET and POST data in traditional way and in SPA
- Traditionaly way: page always reload whenever doing POST or GET request
- SPA: data is added and rendered to page without reloading page, doing GET when visit page for first time, POST will send data to BE without reloading.
